MiniTest
MiniTest does have to be installed via bundler.
MiniTest can handle both TDD and BDD syntax.

RSpec
RSpec is purely BBD
Spec files are must end with _spec.rb

rspec --init
create   .rspec
create   spec/spec_helper.rb

spec_helper.rb is a file to change the configuration of how we want
RSpec to behave.

../ means go up one directory where ./ means within the
current directory

At cmder:
E.g: 
1. cd C:\Users\moses\OneDrive\Documents\ruby_practice\BDDTest\rspec_example\spec
2. rspec
