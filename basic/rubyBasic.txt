block
A block is always invoked from a function with the same name as 
that of the block. This means that if you have a block with the 
name test, then you use the function test to invoke this block

You invoke a block by using the yield statement.

def test
    yield
end
test{puts "Hello world"}

#each {|item|...} => Object
#each => Enumerator

File.open("review.txt) do |review_file| # <== File object is passed as a parameter to the block
    lines = review_file.readlines
end # <== When the block finishes, the file is automatically closed for you
